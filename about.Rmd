title: "About The Educationist"
---
I am 24 year old Genetics PhD student from Arundel, Maine (born and rasied). I love working out, rock climbing, yoga, kayaking, reading in my (very limited) spare time, spending quality time with close friends and family, and of course science!! 

For your expectations...
I will have links for tips/tricks to surviving grad school, how I got started on picking my research topic, and finally about my research.
