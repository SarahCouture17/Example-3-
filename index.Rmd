Hello, Friends!!

Welcome to a Graduate student's truest personal experience with her education and research. Prepare for the ups and downs, mental breakdowns, and the most important part: the research!! As a first year PhD student, I understand how hard it can be not only adapting to Graduate School, but conducting your own research can be scary, unkown territory. I am here to not only share my experience, but to also provide resources and tips to help get you started. Don't be frightened, The Educationist is here.
